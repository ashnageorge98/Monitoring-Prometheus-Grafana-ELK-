# Monitoring-Prometheus-Grafana-ELK-
Hereâ€™s a detailed real-time project on integrating Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) for monitoring and observability in a CI/CD pipeline for DevOps, Cloud Engineer, or SRE roles.

Project Title: Monitoring and Observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack
Objective:
Create a fully automated monitoring and logging solution using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack for a cloud application. This setup will provide metrics, logs, and visualizations to monitor application health, identify issues, and maintain system performance.

Tools Used:
Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting.
Grafana: Visualization of metrics and dashboards.
ELK Stack:
Elasticsearch: Search and analyze logs.
Logstash: Log pipeline tool to collect, transform, and send logs.
Kibana: Visualization for Elasticsearch data.
Docker: To containerize services.
Jenkins or GitHub Actions: To set up the CI/CD pipeline.
AWS/GCP/Azure: Infrastructure for deployment (you can use any cloud provider).

Steps to Implement
1. Setup Infrastructure:
Choose a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) to host your application and monitoring tools. You'll need VMs or container orchestration services (like Kubernetes) to deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.

2. Containerization with Docker:
Containerize the following applications:

Prometheus
Grafana
Elasticsearch
Logstash
Kibana
You can create Dockerfiles for each service or use Docker Compose for multi-container setup.

--------------Docker Compose Code-----------------
3. Config Files:
--------------------Prometheus.conf-------------------
-----------------Logstash.conf---------------------

4. Deploy the Application:
Deploy your sample application on the cloud or containerized environment. The application should expose metrics and logs.

Expose metrics using a library like Prometheus client in your application (e.g., Prometheus Python client or Node.js client).
Set up logging using Filebeat or Fluentd to send logs to Logstash.

5. Integrate Prometheus with Grafana:
Once Prometheus is up, log into Grafana (http://localhost:3000), and add Prometheus as a data source.
Create dashboards to visualize metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, request rates, etc.

6. Set up Alerts in Prometheus:
Configure Prometheus alerts in 
-----------------------prometheus.yml:-----------------------------
Configure the Alertmanager to handle these alerts and send notifications via Slack, email, etc.

7. Deploy ELK Stack for Logs:
Elasticsearch is the storage for logs.
Logstash collects and transforms logs.
Kibana provides the visualization for the log data.
Set up Filebeat or Fluentd on the application to collect logs and forward them to Logstash:
------------------filebeat---------------

8. Visualize Logs in Kibana:
Access Kibana at http://localhost:5601.
Create index patterns for Elasticsearch indices and visualize logs.

9. CI/CD Pipeline Integration:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the monitoring stack deployment using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

-------------------------Example GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy Prometheus and Grafana:-----------------------

10. Add Observability to the Application:
Implement Prometheus metrics in your code (e.g., app_metrics endpoint).
Implement structured logging using a logging library (e.g., Log4j, winston).

11. Test Monitoring and Alerts:
Simulate high CPU usage or memory issues in the application to see if Prometheus triggers alerts.
Test by generating logs (e.g., HTTP request logs) and verify they appear in Kibana.

12. Scaling and High Availability (Optional):
In production, you can implement HA for Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK using Kubernetes or by deploying these services in a clustered mode (e.g., Prometheus Federation or Elasticsearch Cluster).

Outcomes:
Full monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
Centralized logging solution using ELK Stack for log analytics.
Integrated CI/CD pipeline to automate monitoring stack deployment.
Scalable and production-ready monitoring and observability solution.
Skills Gained:
Hands-on experience with monitoring and logging tools in a real-world environment.
Experience with Docker and CI/CD integration.
Ability to monitor and troubleshoot cloud applications using observability stacks.
Practical knowledge in integrating alerts and dashboards into the application lifecycle.
